# Runs the package's tests on Linux, in the swift:6.3-noble container image, so the claim that the

# Darwin-only is expected to compile out; a failure here is a real portability regression.

# With no trait list given, the suite runs twice. First with `HTTPPortable` enabled, which forwards
# the trait to swifty-networking and builds its AsyncHTTPClient transport and the SwiftNIO stack
# beneath it. Then under the package's default trait set, which enables none, proving what a consumer
# who asks for no trait gets.
#
# Usage: ./Scripts/linux-test.sh [additional swiftpm arguments]
#   e.g. ./Scripts/linux-test.sh --filter SwiftNPSDataModelsTests
#
# Set SWIFT_NPS_TRAITS to run once under that trait list instead:
#   e.g. SWIFT_NPS_TRAITS=HTTPPortable ./Scripts/linux-test.sh
# Set it to the empty string for a single run under the default trait set.
