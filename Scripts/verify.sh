# The pre-commit gate. Every invariant here is one the compiler cannot see and the test suite cannot
# fail on, so a grep is the only guard it has.
#
# Usage:
#   Scripts/verify.sh              run every check against this tree; exit 0 iff all pass
#   Scripts/verify.sh --self-test  prove every check still discriminates: each one is run against a
#                                  synthesized clean tree (must pass) and a tree with one planted
#                                  violation (must fail), outside the repository
#
# Two kinds of check, and each declares which kind it is:
#   - A prohibition greps for a forbidden construct. An empty match set is the passing state, so a
#     live run proves nothing about whether the grep still works; only --self-test does.
#   - A derivation builds a set from the tree and compares it to what the tree promises. An empty
#     derived set FAILS, because a derivation that finds nothing has lost its subject.
# A prohibition scoped to one directory first asserts that the directory holds Swift source, so a
# renamed or emptied target fails loudly instead of passing a check about nothing.
