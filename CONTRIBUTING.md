# Contributing to swift-nps

Thanks for your interest. Contributions are welcome; every change to the public surface lands in
`CHANGELOG.md`.

## Getting started

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Open the package directory in Xcode 26 or later.
3. Build and run tests on the `swift-nps` scheme (⌘U), or `swift test` from the command line.

## Guidelines

- **Layers:** `SwiftNPSDataModels` depends on nothing. It never imports swifty-networking, `URLSession`,
  or any transport type; if a type needs one to exist, it belongs in `SwiftNPSData`. `SwiftNPSData` adds
  behavior, never models.
- **Public API:** every public symbol needs a DocC comment.
- **Portability:** `SwiftNPSDataModels` imports Foundation only as the fallback to `FoundationEssentials`.
  Darwin-only code sits inside `#if canImport(Darwin)`, and code that uses the portable transport sits
  inside `#if HTTPPortable`. `Scripts/linux-test.sh` runs the suite on Linux in Docker, with the trait
  on and off.
- **Concurrency:** no actors on the client; shared state is `Mutex` or `Atomic`. Errors are typed and
  mapped at each layer. Inject a `Clock`; never sleep or read the wall clock.
- **Tests:** Swift Testing only, and never against the live API; decode fixtures recorded from it.
  Every `@Suite` carries `.timeLimit(.minutes(suiteTimeLimitMinutes))`, so a test that stops making
  progress fails its suite instead of holding the run open.
- **Style:** `swift format lint --strict --recursive Sources Tests` must report zero findings.
  Declarations are ordered alphabetically within their groupings unless an inline comment says why
  not.
- **Gate:** `Scripts/verify.sh` runs the format lint and every repository invariant the compiler
  cannot see. Run it before every commit; it must exit 0. `Scripts/verify.sh --self-test` proves each
  check still trips on a planted violation.
- **Scope:** no macros, no interceptor or middleware pipelines. Open an issue to discuss additions
  before investing in a large PR.

## Pull requests

- Target `main`. One concern per PR.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` under **Unreleased**.

## Reporting issues

Include a minimal reproduction where possible.
